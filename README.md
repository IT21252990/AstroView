   ```bash
       cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
       npm install

## APPLICATION BUILD PROCESS
### Firebase Setup Instructions

1. **Install Firebase Tools:**

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, install Firebase Tools globally using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and log in to Firebase using the following command:

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

   This command will open a browser window asking you to log in with your Google account.

3. **Set up Firebase in your Project:**

   Navigate to your React.js project directory and initialize Firebase by running:

   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

   Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to select Firebase Hosting and your Firebase project.

4. **Build Your React Application:**

   Since you're using Vite, build your React application for production:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will generate a production build of your React app in the `dist` directory.

5. **Configure Firebase Hosting:**

   After building your React application, navigate to your Firebase project directory and open the `firebase.json` file. Ensure your hosting configuration looks something like this:

   ```json
   {
     "hosting": {
       "public": "dist",
       "ignore": [],
       "rewrites": [
         {
           "source": "**",
           "destination": "/index.html"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   This configuration tells Firebase to serve the files from the `dist` directory and rewrite all URLs to `index.html`.

6. **Deploy Your Application:**

   Once your Firebase project is configured, you can deploy your application by running:

   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

   Firebase will upload your files to the cloud and deploy your application. After the deployment is complete, Firebase will provide you with a hosting URL where your application is live.
